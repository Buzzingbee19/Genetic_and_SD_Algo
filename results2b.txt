 In this section, we implemented a greedy algorithm for our coloring
problems, and then compared our results to those from our exhaustive
algorithm.  To implement the greedy algorithm, we  sorted the nodes by
its' out degree, and colored each node in decreasing degree order.  In
coloring a node, the algorithm randomly colors the node fom a list of valid
colors.  If no valid color exists, it randomly colors it, creating a conflict.
This algorithm is much more efficient than our exhaustive algorithm, as
even the largest instances only took a few seconds.  This is because our
greedy algorithm runs in O(|e|) time.  This is achieved because the program
sets the number of degrees for each node, and then looks at each node only
once.  Because there are always more edges than nodes, we can ignore the
number of nodes in the graph.  While we have to sort the degrees, 
thee are only n entries, we can ignore this amount of time elapsed.
Additionally, we must look through all edges again, this time comparing every
 given nodes with it's neighbors for conflicts.  This can be considered in
 our runtime, but since this adds O(|e|) time, it only adds a 2 into our runtime, which can be ignored.
